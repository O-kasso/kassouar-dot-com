I'm a software tinkerer in **Toronto, ON** with a soft spot for continuous delivery, developer-tooling, open-source, digital privacy, and vim bindings.

Really good at breaking things, and almost as good at fixing them.
On a mission to level‚Äêup my skills and explore innovations that balance user-experience, business-value, and privacy/security.
