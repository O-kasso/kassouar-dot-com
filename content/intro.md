I'm a software tinkerer in **Toronto, ON** with a soft spot for test automation, continuous integration, developer tools, vim keybindings, user experience, digital privacy, and Pokémon.

Really good at breaking things, and almost as good at fixing them.
On a mission to level‑up my skills, work on interesting problems, and [hack
the planet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3CKgkyc7Qo&t=20s).
