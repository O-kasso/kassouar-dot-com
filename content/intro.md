I'm a passionate autodidact in the **San Francisco Bay Area** with a soft spot for developer experience, CI/CD, and privacy-by-design. My core values are craftsmanship, mentorship, creativity, and user-empathy. 

On a mission to further hone my craft while delivering optimal software that real humans actually enjoy using. Over a decade of experience building systems that allow products to scale while continuously growing business value. 

Also interested in learning more about Augmented/Mixed Reality and LLMs.
